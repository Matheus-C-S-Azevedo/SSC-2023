# SSC-2023

"Tup√£" Zip file for swift playground with an iPad

"Swift_Student_Challenge-2023" file for Xcode with an iPhone real device


# Advises
** App needs to be used in portrait **

I couldn't set the app to accept only portrait mode in playground, so I ask you to lock the ipad in portrait mode and use it this way

** Augmented reality content **

The game uses the camera to show 3D objects in augmented reality, I urge you to use PlayGround on iPad to be able to use the device's camera

Try aiming the iPad camera at textured surfaces, because RealityKit does not detect solid color surfaces very well (during testing I was pointing at my keyboard)

Even when loading the 3D models asynchronously, the game freeze for a few moments while loading the 3D models, please wait, it doesn't take long time

As soon as the game detects a plane it places the 3D model on the detected plane, as soon as the camera opens, aim the iPad at the place you want to place the 3D model.

** Sound **

The game has a nature sound during gameplay use a headset for a relaxing experience :-)

Enjoy.
